The best (and perhaps only) viable sense of recall that I have so far encountered were field recordings, a great many taken on foreign trains and in the presence of good Sophie, that I listened to on a dead log in a public forest in Paris. My legs were freezing and there were bugs in my teeth. I didn’t say a word, because I didn’t want to frighten the gathering birds, but as I listened to these recordings I did cry, because in them, for what felt like the first time, I gained at last access to true memory."},{date:"2025-03-05",image:"/assets/images/bath_cat.png",text:"You, without needing to check, know the relative size of our wrists.

Sleeping, I greet your image in dreams and tell you about how wonderful it is to know you where I’m awake, where reproduction can never fully reach."},{date:"2025-03-12",image:"/assets/images/island_trees.png",text:"I find myself grateful for the sinking arm, and for the company of my friends, and for good dinner.
