        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm a multimedia artist working with ceramic, kiln-cast glass, and novel view synthesis, a form of digital 3D visualization. My practice engages materiality, anonymity, repetition, and obfuscation as both method and subject.</p>

        <p>I studied computer science at Oberlin College before completing my first artist residency at <a href="https://pioneerworks.org/residency/sage-vouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pioneer Works</a> in Spring 2023, returning for a second in Fall 2024. My work was featured in <em><a href="https://www.peripheriesjournal.com/new-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peripheries Issue 6</a></em> (2024), an annual art and research journal from Harvard Divinity School that explores the "interstices between discourses, traditions, languages, forms, and genres."</p>
