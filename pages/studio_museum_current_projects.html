        <h1>Methods</h1>

        <p>One way to think about my practice is as a modern-to-analog high-low. The core of my sculptural work is both highly technical and deeply ancient. I consider myself an experimental ceramicist, often pushing the limits of chemical and structural material composition in handbuilding. Glass casting, due to its material and technical demands, is a somewhat niche practice—but I’m drawn to it precisely because those demands push my work further. I also care deeply about keeping this practice alive and teaching it to others. The way kiln-cast glass plays with expectations of its materiality is emblematic of the surrealism at my practice’s core. Craft is to me, the highest calling.</p>

    <div class="content-card right">
          <p>When I first started presenting my work publicly, I felt self-conscious about how technology and craft are perceived differently—despite both being highly precise disciplines. Tech, with its societal coding and intentionally obfuscated means of use, is often treated as separate from craft. Over time, I’ve leaned into this tension by treating the technical manifestations of my work as unreliable narrators—I hack 3D printers and 3D files, and I feed confusing images into different algorithms to construct 3D scenes from them.</p>

          <p>You'll also see me blur the line between what is precious and immutable versus what is a tool. In some recent explorations, I use physical objects to give fully digital environments a sense of familiar weight. This slippage between the material and the digital is central to my practice.</p>

<h1>My Themes</h1>

<p>Maximalism, information theory, archiving, and control are the central themes of my work.</p>

<p>I often think of my work as an extension of my body. You'll see cracks, leaks, scars, and structures I consider analogous to the cell. Some pieces are unstable and untrustworthy. Some, I destroy.</p>

      <h1>Ongoing Projects I'm Excited About</h1>

      <p>For the past two years, I’ve been collaborating with friends on an augmented reality walking tour of West Oakland. We recently showed our first demo at the New Museum. As part of the project’s grant funding, I’ve had the privilege of designing and building a site that explores the past, present, and future of community-led stewardship in Oakland, which launched this July to accompany <a href="https://museumca.org/blog/black-spaces-reclaim-remain-now-open-at-omca/"> an Oakland Museum exhibit on the history of redlining and the ongoing stewardship of land and housing </a>.</p>

      <p>Those two projects live here:</p>

  <h1>What I'm Working On Now (updates coming 10/24/25 !)</h1>

  <p>My current focus is developing a multimedia installation that combines the ebullient, surreal meal plans of the <em>Ebony Test Kitchen Cookbook</em> with my own writings on the anxiety of personal mythology and the optimism of cultural pride.</p>

  <p>I've begun working on the objects for the first meal plan I’m approaching: <em>Breakfast for 25</em>.</p>

  <p>The idea is to create a place setting with a collection of ceramic and cast glass vessels, plates, and silverware, each specifically made to serve a given meal. Accompanying the work will be a collection of 3D visuals and writing, and I’m currently exploring how these elements might exist within the physical installation. For an opening, I imagine an actual meal being served using the pieces in the installation.</p>
