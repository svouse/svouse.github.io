        <h1>Methods</h1>

        <p>One way to think about my practice is as a modern-to-analog high-low. The core of my sculptural work is both highly technical and deeply ancient. I consider myself an experimental ceramicist, often pushing the limits of chemical and structural material composition in handbuilding. Glass casting, due to its material and technical demands, is a somewhat niche practice—but I’m drawn to it precisely because those demands push my work further. I also care deeply about keeping this practice alive and teaching it to others. The way kiln-cast glass plays with expectations of its materiality is emblematic of the surrealism at my practice’s core. Craft is to me, the highest calling.</p>

          <p>When I first started presenting my work publicly, I felt self-conscious about how technology and craft are perceived differently—despite both being highly precise disciplines. Tech, with its societal coding and intentionally obfuscated means of use, is often treated as separate from craft. Over time, I’ve leaned into this tension by treating the technical manifestations of my work as unreliable narrators—I hack 3D printers and 3D files, and I feed confusing images into different algorithms to construct 3D scenes from them.</p>

          <p>You'll also see me blur the line between what is precious and immutable versus what is a tool. In some recent explorations, I use physical objects to give fully digital environments a sense of familiar weight. This slippage between the material and the digital is central to my practice.</p>

<h1>My Themes</h1>

<p>Maximalism, information theory, archiving, and control are the central themes of my work.</p>

<p>I often think of my work as an extension of my body. You'll see cracks, leaks, scars, and structures I consider analogous to the cell. Some pieces are unstable and untrustworthy. Some, I destroy.</p>

  <p>My practice extends from a core idea in my honors thesis—specifically, the study of decentralized human security. One of the seven categories I identified as essential was community security. The definition is up for debate, but right now, I see it as an ethos of information exchange, archiving, and communication—a means of seeking, defining, and tracking that principle. In part, my practice is an ongoing effort to shape a working definition of community security, one that I and those engaging with my work can build together.</p>

  <p>My physical materials are primarily ceramic and glass, though for my current project, I may introduce metal. When I use found objects—specifically ceramic waste—I source them from Dead Horse Bay, a radioactive beach near Jamaica Bay. Robert Moses filled it with the debris of the predominantly Black and brown neighborhoods he razed to expand the city's landmass. It didn’t work.</p>

      <h1>Ongoing Projects I'm Excited About</h1>

      <p>For the past two years, I’ve been collaborating with friends on an augmented reality walking tour of West Oakland. We recently showed our first demo at the New Museum. As part of the project’s grant funding, I’ve had the privilege of designing and building a site that explores the past, present, and future of community-led stewardship in Oakland. The work will be exhibited at the Oakland Museum this July.</p>

      <p>Those two projects live here:</p>

  <h1>What I'm Working On Now</h1>

  <p>My current focus is developing a multimedia installation that combines the ebullient, surreal meal plans of the <em>Ebony Test Kitchen Cookbook</em> with my own writings on the anxiety of personal mythology and the optimism of cultural pride.</p>

  <p>I've begun working on the objects for the first meal plan I’m approaching: <em>Breakfast for 25</em>.</p>

  <p>The idea is to create a place setting with a collection of ceramic and cast glass vessels, plates, and silverware, each specifically made to serve a given meal. Accompanying the work will be a collection of 3D visuals and writing, and I’m currently exploring how these elements might exist within the physical installation. For an opening, I imagine an actual meal being served using the pieces in the installation.</p>

  <p>My interest in the book is threefold.</p>

  <p><strong>First, I saw myself in it.</strong> Food is a direct inheritance from my mother, a stubborn Ayurveda green-market nut. I love her so much. In college, I struggled as one of only two Black students in my student-run dining co-op. I was frustrated that something I had grown up with was being presented to me as new or novel. Some people even acted as though my connection to “crunchy” food culture made me less Black. I coped by trolling. I was elected the breadmaker, responsible for baking weekly bread for 110 co-op members. My bread announcement emails were cryptic, surreal, and sometimes antagonistic—full of strange narratives or thinly veiled frustrations with the co-op. People loved them, which I found funny. I became somewhat infamous, which annoyed me (I was annoyed by a lot back then). People treated my writing as unique, but I didn’t see it that way. To me, it was in line with the way Freda DeKnight, sometimes personifying herself as the "Little Brown Chef," attached personal narratives to these meal plans. The book oscillates between hyperspecificity—curating the host’s role, feeling, and intention—and vague gaps in food quantities and table settings, leaving room for interpretation.</p>

  <p><strong>Second, the materials lend themselves to experimentation.</strong> For this project, I’m pushing myself to work figuratively. I’ve been experimenting with porcelain clay piped through a silicone frosting bag to create accents that feel distinctly cake-like, capitalizing on my work’s characteristic organic wobbles. In glass, I’m exploring the interplay between cast glass and traditional cut crystal. For the purposes of this installation, the manipulation of light is a key feature, contributing to the work’s ethereal feel.</p>

  <p><strong>Third, I see this project as a synthesis of my anxieties, cryptic tendencies, and obsession with control.</strong> It merges my writing’s underlying tension, the opacity of my work, and my meticulous approach to craft into a study of what it means to be the “perfect host.” This, to me, is analogous to my role as an artist and how I cope being black in white spaces: a balance between desperately communicating an ideal and leaving space for interpretation. I believe in the idea that a perfectly constructed environment—in this case, a dinner party—can be instantly understood without being imposed. It’s a fraught balance that I see as a kind of metaphysical quest for understanding.</p>
